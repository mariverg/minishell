Every night when the sky turns red up above
Every night when the sky turns red up above
I feel the beat in my veins
I feel the beat in my veins
And I'm searching for love
And I'm searching for love
You know that hips don't lie
You know that hips don't lie
I leave you hypnotized
I leave you hypnotized
Just give me one more try to make you feel that vibe
Just give me one more try to make you feel that vibe
When it goes (ra-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta)
When it goes (ra-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta)
My body is a weapon
My body is a weapon
(Ra-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta)
(Ra-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta)
We're gonna hit the floor
We're gonna hit the floor
(Ra-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta)
(Ra-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta)
We're gonna make it happen
We're gonna make it happen
(Ra-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta)
(Ra-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta)
I don't wanna stop, we push it to the limit
I don't wanna stop, we push it to the limit
Together we will crash the morning light
Together we will crash the morning light
